<p> I was have lived in New Jersey my entire life!
<br> I am very into politics, so naturally, I am a Policy Studies major in the Maxwell School. 
<br> In my free time, I love to watch baseball -- even though being an Orioles fan is just constant pain. 
<br>I also like to create all kinds of art, but writing has to be my favorite! </p>
